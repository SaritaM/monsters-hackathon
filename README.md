## Getting Started

Is a chimera stalking in your neighborhood? A swamp thing camped in your local park?

Maybe it's time to enlist a 21st century monster hunter.

These heroes are willing to risk life and limb for your security, but they don't work for free. Usually. The sane ones, anyway.

So incentivize hunters to close your case ASAP with a juicy reward in the form of cold, hard cash.

Bounties are public, and everyone can see the recent bounties published. To create a bounty, a user must create an account and log in, at which point they can offer up a reward for anyone willing to rid them of their local infestation.

Like Witcher, but with shotguns.

Okay, so. Having never touched Clerk or Convex before, I'm going to call this 4-hour attempt a success, though there's SO MUCH more I wanted to do.

My brain is mush and my right eye has been twitching for the last half-hour, so I'm going to call this project "good enough" and have a sleep. Tomorrow, I'll come back for another pass and create a v2 branch where I build out the stretch goals that were taunting me while I was trying to make my form happen.

If it weren't for NextJS, Shadcn, and my own copy-paste form components frankensteined together into a code soup, I wouldn't have finished on time.

Which means that the dependency list is not reflective of what I actually needed (if only I had a penny for every node_module I installed...). I didn't use half of the components I built or copied, and eagle-eyed snoops will spot the "tasks" schema I saved per the Convex quickstart guide but, for obvious reasons, didn't need. Why didn't I delete them? Why does the sun rise in the east? What is life, even?
